# Bhasikoro bikes (online shop)

Online shop built from zero, made without the use of any template or plugin.

## Purpose

We developed this webpage for the Internet and Web Development Technologies subject for the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB) with the intention to learn the technologies and languages used.

## Features

### Front-end

The user can access the webpage without logging in and can navigate through the different products. There is three different types of products (bikes, wheels and accessories). The user can view the price and click on it to add it to the shopping cart. A small number with the quantity of products appears and updates in the shopping cart icon as soon as the user adds one to it. In order to validate the shopping cart, the user needs to register or log in. After that, the products in the shopping cart disappear. The user can also perform a search within all the products.

### Back-end

The admins of the online shop can log in using an especial account. When it is detected as an admin, it gives the extra ability on the webpage to add products or modify them, even uploading new images from an easy to use page.

## Technologies used

* HTML5
* CSS
* JavaScript
* PHP - Server side scripting language
* MySQL - Relational database
* AJAX - Asynchronous JavaScript And XMLHttpRequest
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com) - Fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library
* [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) - Checks the markup of Web documents

## Structure

The structure follows the MVC (Model View Controller) architectural pattern.

## Security

The forms are validated both from the client and server side to check for irregular data inputs. This prevents from cross-site scripting and SQL Injection techniques.

Sensitive information (like passwords) that is contained in the database is also encrypted using a hash.
