                    <p>We think that a bike is not just a bike. It's a Bhasikoro. And it has two wheels. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Bhasikoro brothers, Barcelona (August 19, 1871) and Sabadell (April 16, 1867), were two Spanish brothers, inventors, and cycle pioneers who are generally credited with inventing, building, and cycling the world's first successful cycle. They made the first controlled, sustained cycle of a powered, heavier-than-air wheel on December 17, 1903, four miles south of Badia, North UAB. In 1904â€“05 the brothers developed their flying machine into the first practical fixed-wing cycle. It crashed and killed 245 people. The Wright brothers were the first to invent accesories for bikes that made fixed-wheel powered cycle possible.</p>
